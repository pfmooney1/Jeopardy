# Jeopardy
Instant Classroom Jeopardy
About The Project
I made this to make playing "Review Jeopardy" games with my classes of students easier. In the past you would have had to fiddle with typing and formatting and setting up dozens of slides.
This project makes at as easy as "copy, paste, go."

Built With
VanillaJS
CSS with Grid


Usage
To use, copy-paste your list of questions and answers into the main field, then hit "START". Like the gameshow Jeopardy, click boxes to display questions to answer.
You can also click on categories at the top to rename them.
